#### My name is Junhao Xue (Danny), a third year Software Engineering student at the University of Calgary. Mandarin is my first language, but I speak fluent English too. Recently I made a <a href="https://youtu.be/E5ClVbQm0fg" target="_blank">testimonial</a> to support the Global Engagement Plan event for the University of Calgary International as a recipient of Energizing Canada International Scholarship. I can speak and understand some Japanese as well as a little Spanish that I learned in my junior high. Badminton is my favourite sport and I used to play a lot before the lockdown. Additionally, I am always a big fan of video games and recently I have started to look into some physical engines for game design, such as Unity. I may try to come up with some games sometime later this year. Stay tuned.
