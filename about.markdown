My name is Junhao Xue (Danny), a third year Software Engineering student at the University of Calgary. I learned C, C++ and Java from school. I enjoy video games a lot, so recently I have started to look into some physical engines for game design, such as Unity. I may try to come up with some games sometime later this year, so stay tuned.
