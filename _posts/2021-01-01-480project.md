title: Movie Theatre Ticket Reservation System
---


### A java project simulating the system for booking tickets at a movie theatre
### Created by [Junhao Xue](mailto:junhao.xue1@ucalgary.ca), [Matthew Wells](mailto:matthew.wells@ucalgary.ca), [Minh Vo](mailto:minh.vo1@ucalgary.ca) and [Michael Vassilev](mailto:michael.vassilev1@ucalgary.ca)		

### How to run the program
1. `javac *.java`
2. `java main`

Functions include browsing movies, showtimes and seats, as well as cancelling tickets and registering users.

The source code is available [here](https://github.com/BGDanny/Movie-Theatre)

You can see how we designed the program and planned the implementation [here]({% link /assets/file/ENSF480_Project_Group27.pdf%})

*Note: The program may not compile on your machine based on the fact that we used a local SQL Database*
